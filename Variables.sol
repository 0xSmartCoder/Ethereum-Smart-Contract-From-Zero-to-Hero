    address public lastSender;  // stores the address of the last caller

     function recordCall() public payable {
        // msg.sender â†’ global variable that represents 
        // the address of the account calling this function
        lastSender = msg.sender; // who called     

        // msg.value â†’ global variable that represents 
        // the amount of ether (in wei) sent with this function call
        lastValue = msg.value;    //ether send
    }

 /*   ðŸ‘‰ Important: Global variables do not store themselves permanently.
         They are temporary built-ins provided by Solidity.
         But we can copy their values into state variables 
         (like lastSender and lastValue) to save them on the blockchain.

         âš¡ Other global variables include:
         - block.number â†’ current block number
         - block.timestamp â†’ current blockâ€™s timestamp
         - block.coinbase â†’ minerâ€™s address
         - tx.origin â†’ original sender of the transaction (use with caution)
